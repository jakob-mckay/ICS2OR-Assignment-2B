  <p1><br> Gabe Newell, also known as Gaben is the co-founder of Valve. He is now the head of Valve after his partner in crime "Mike Harrington" quit Valve after he thought it wasn't going to get anywhere. But Gabe refused to give up on his idea, and in 1998 he released his first title Half-Life and sold over 9 million copies within the next ten years.<br> <br> Gabe was born November 3, 1962, he attended Harvard University from 1980 to 1983, but soon dropped out when he wanted to go work for Microsoft. Which is where he took a part in the development of the early Windows 1.01, 1.02 versions etc. He founded Valve in 1996 alongside a fellow co-worker from Microsoft, "Mike Harrington". In 2011, Newell stated that some of his favorite video games were Super Mario 64, Doom, and a Burroughs mainframe version of Star Trek. Doom is the game that initially inspired Mr. Gaben to get the idea of Valve, and the future that video games help with them. He also found the art in video games after playing and enjoying super mario 64.</p1>
